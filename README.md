# Testing PreTeXt Slideshow 

Slides are not printed correctly when following instructions at 
https://github.com/stephen-flood/slideshow-test
and the example at 
https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/blob/dev/examples/sample-slideshow/sample-slideshow.xml

Are HTML slides not supported at the moment?
